Pendrive Frenzy
===============

This is a tool for copying files and images to multiple USB drives as 
fast as possible.  The application starts copying data at the moment it 
detects a new drive.


Colors
------

The application indicates copying progress using colors:

  * white - there is nothing to do,
  * orange - in progress,
  * green - everything done, drive can be removed,
  * red - something has failed.


Configuration
-------------

The application has to be executed with a config file as its parameter.  
Some examples are attached. Every project needs a valid directory 
structure. In a configuration directory there has to be:

  * the config file (it can be named config.ini),
  * partitions directory, which contains

    * directories - if You want to copy files,
    * files - if You want to write an image,
  
    named with partition numbers,

  * scripts directory, which contains optional script to run after    
    creation of the MBR or a partition; their names are set in a config 
    file.

Example of a directory structure:

::

  config-directory/
      config.ini
      partitions/
          1/  - copy files
          2   - write image
          3/  - copy files
      scripts/
          post-mbr.sh
          post-part.sh


In the config file You have to define in which mode You want this tool 
to operate: copy-only or create-mbr. Copy-only only copies data.  
Create-mbr first creates partitions via MBR modification and then copies 
data.

There is a tool attached, which will help You generate a config file, 
for example:

::

  $ generate-config.py /dev/sdd

This would output a config file using current /dev/sdd partitions 
properties as its base.


Dependencies
------------

The tool uses rsync (with --delete) to copy files and dd to copy 
images.

It creates MBR and filesystems using UDisks via DBus.

Additional information about drive's geometry is generated by 
python-parted (so it's a dependency).


Repository
----------

Current version is the versatile branch descendant. Last old version has 
been uploaded as commit 9:925aa80838b2.
